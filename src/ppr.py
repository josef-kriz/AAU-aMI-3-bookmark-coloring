# Implementation of personalized pagerank (PPR) with the coloring bookmark algorithm (CBA)
# graph - networkx graph with nodes and edges
# bookmark - a node we simulate the spread of paint from
# alpha - each node keeps 1âˆ’alpha portion of the paint that it receives
# epsilon - the process terminates if the paint to be redistributed at each node exceeds a small constant epsilon
